# Integrated Smart Monitoring & Predictive System for Thermal Power Plants

## 📌 Overview
This project was developed during my internship at NTPC.  
The system is designed to monitor, analyze, and optimize key operational parameters of a thermal power plant.

It integrates real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance insights, load forecasting, and emission tracking into a unified intelligent dashboard.
